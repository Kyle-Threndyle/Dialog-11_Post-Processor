functional post for a Deckel FP50 CC-T with DIalog 11 control. 
I did not have a working tool changer so I cannot comment on that portion 
It was working well with all toolpaths as well as drilling, deep drilling and tapping cycles from Fusion 360.
DSI helped me make some changes around directly placing the cycles in the main program instead of calling a sub routine.
